    "DESCRIPTION" : "Hello, I am Kulendra, doing MS in CS from Virginia Tech and have two years of relevant experience in the field of software development. I was supposed to do an internship at Berkeley Net, Summer 2020. Unfortunately because of COVID19, my internship offer got rescinded. Please visit my LinkedIn profile to find more details about me and my projects. I am really thankful to Cloudflare team for providing me an opportunity to learn about cloudflare workers. I am amused that how easily high performance serverless web application can be build and deployed within few seconds using Cloudflare Edge Network. It was really a great learning experience for me. Stay safe and enjoy!",
